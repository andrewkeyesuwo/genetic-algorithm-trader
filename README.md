NOTE: This project is an altered implementation of a genetic algorithm designed for solving the travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm approach https://github.com/aks47u/Travelling-Salesman-Problem

# Goal
This project attempts to predict forex / stock trends using a genetic algorithm approach. Each technique used to attempt prediction is scored based on profitiability testing of previous data. The techniques with the best results are bred to produce a new similar technique. This continues for a customizable number of runs or until a target profitability is met.
